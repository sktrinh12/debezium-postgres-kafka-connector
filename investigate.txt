To investigate if the error is caused by running out of SGA for the LogMiner query, you can follow these steps:

Connect to the Oracle database server as a user with DBA privileges.

Check the alert log file for any recent error messages related to the database instance or LogMiner sessions. The location of the alert log file depends on the database configuration. You can check the background_dump_dest or user_dump_dest database parameters to find the location of the alert log file. For example, you can use the following command to display the most recent error messages in the alert log:

shell
Copy code
$ tail -n 100 alert_{SID}.log
Replace {SID} with the actual system identifier (SID) of your database instance.

Look for any error messages related to LogMiner or SGA. For example, you may see error messages like "ORA-04031: unable to allocate n bytes of shared memory" or "ORA-4031: unable to allocate X bytes of shared memory".

Check the size of the SGA and ensure that it is large enough to accommodate the LogMiner query. You can use the following command to display the current size of the SGA:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM V$SGAINFO;
You may need to increase the size of the SGA if it is too small to handle the LogMiner query. You can use the following command to increase the size of the SGA:

sql
Copy code
ALTER SYSTEM SET SGA_TARGET = {new_size} SCOPE=BOTH;
Replace {new_size} with the new size of the SGA in bytes.

If the error is related to LogMiner session, you can check how many logs were added to the LogMiner session by running the following SQL query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM V$LOGMNR_LOGS;
This query will return the number of logs that are currently available in the LogMiner session.

If you find that the LogMiner session is running out of space, you may need to increase the size of the redo log files to accommodate the LogMiner query. You can use the following command to increase the size of the redo log files:

sql
Copy code
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP {group_number} SIZE {size}M;
Replace {group_number} with the number of the new group and {size} with the size of the new log file in megabytes.

Note: Increasing the size of the redo log files can be a time-consuming process and may require downtime for the database.

Once you have identified and addressed any issues related to SGA or LogMiner, you can try running the LogMiner query again to see if the error has been resolved.
